# Enhanced human activity recognition through deep multi-layer perceptron on UCI-HAR dataset. <br>
_**Abstract**_ <br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Using the UCI-HAR dataset, this paper examines Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from the perspectives of data science and artificial intelligence. The primary objective is to present and evaluate the effectiveness of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, concentrating on six different activity categories. We train and assess the MLP model using the UCI-HAR dataset, contrasting its results with those of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The MLP model shows competitive results, attaining an amazing 97% validation and testing accuracy, highlighting its efficiency for smaller datasets. An extensive study is carried out to assess the model's adaptation to a larger MotionSense dataset using confusion matrices and cross-entropy, the model shows robustness with an accuracy of 89%. The MLP model performs admirably, demonstrating its capacity to pick up complex patterns. Results from comparative analysis with CNN are competitive, especially when dealing with smaller datasets. The suggested MLP model shows up as a practical and efficient way to advance HAR techniques. Its remarkable performance and versatility not only show its usefulness in real-world scenarios but also point to interesting directions for further study in the area of human activity recognition.
